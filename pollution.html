<p><em>Asexuality</em></p>
<p>Asexuality, an orientation estimated to apply to 1% of the global population,
although some think the number is higher.</p>
<p>“Our society is increasingly hyper-sexualised,” she says, “and that can make it particularly alienating for asexual people who don’t have those feelings, or don’t want to live that life.”</p>
<p>Asexuality has sometimes been dubbed the “forgotten” or “invisible” orientation owing to its lack of public prominence. Until recently it was deemed a medical issue by the US’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – which added an exception in 2013 to state that asexuals do not have a desire disorder – and many continue to erroneously dismiss it as an affliction.</p>
<p>It has also been labelled “the world’s first internet orientation,” implying that people who feel this way have only existed since the advent of the internet – and suggesting it’s a fad.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">9.2</span> Plastics</h2>
<p><strong>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)</strong></p>
<p><em>Independent</em></p>
<p>The United States recycles less than 9 per cent of items
but “the plastics industry has managed to convince us all that it’s our fault.”</p>
<p>Plastic production is booming with more than half of all plastic ever made
created within the last two decades.</p>
<p>Vast amounts of plastic aren’t recycled for reasons including its complex mix of resins;
contamination or difficulty in sorting; or the simple fact it’s cheaper to make virgin plastic.</p>
<p>The pollution ends up in landfill, is incinerated or shipped overseas to less wealthy nations.</p>
<p>An estimated 10 million tons of plastic ends up in the ocean annually -
the equivalent of a garbage truck every minute.</p>
<p>Despite spending millions of dollars in ad campaigns that highlighted consumers’ responsibility for recycling, the plastics industry was aware that large-scale recycling would not work.</p>
<p>The recycling movement is “often bankrolled by companies that wanted to drill home
the message that it is your responsibility
to deal with the environmental impact of their products.</p>
<p>The “real behaviour change” has to come from those who make the plastic in the first place.
Legislation called “extended producer responsibility (EPR)”
would shift more obligation to industry for the environmental price-tag of their products.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.2.1</span> Finance</h3>
<p><em>Memo</em></p>
<p>To address plastic pollution, a fundamental shift
away from business models that depend on sin-
gle-use packaging towards those that prioritise
reuse and more localized supply chains and services
is needed.
Banks should make funding of corporate
actors within the plastic packaging supply
chain contingent on companies implement-
ing best practice.
Governments should stop protecting banks
and re-write the rules of finance to hold
banks liable for the damage caused by their
lending.
Companies must adopt international best
practice to reduce the production and use
of virgin plastic and increase the reusability
of plastic packaging products.</p>
<p>Banks are silent and out of touch
with reality
This global public outcry led to a set of govern-
ment and business responses. As of June 2020, it
was reported that 69 countries had passed a full or
partial ban on plastic bags. Some companies have
made comparatively strong commitments to reduce
plastic packaging. Despite public outcry over the serious impacts
of plastic pollution, and efforts by some companies
within the plastic value chain to reduce their impacts,
none of the banks analysed have developed due
diligence systems, contingent loan criteria or financ-
ing exclusions when it comes to this industry. This
means banks are currently not taking responsibility
to understand, measure, and reduce the impacts of
their loans within the plastics value chain.
By indiscriminately funding actors in the plastic
supply chain, banks have failed to acknowledge
their role in enabling global plastic pollution. They
have fallen far behind the crowd of other actors that
contribute to the plastic pollution crisis.</p>
<p>By indiscriminately funding actors in the plastic

They have fallen far behind other actors that
contribute to the plastic pollution crisis.</p>
<p>The concentration of finance
from banks Headquarted in
a few jurisdictions indicates
that legislative measures, such
as introducing lender liability
which holds financiers and
investors responsible for the
impacts their financing has on
biodiversity, could be highly
impactful even when initially
implemented in a small number
of geographic regions.</p>
<p>A limited number of banks have started to adopt
policies that allow them to limit investments for other
high biodiversity impacting sectors such as fossil
fuels, forest products, and some agricultural commod-
ities. However, this has not yet occurred for plastics.</p>
<p>Governments and financial institutions
should both recognise that investment in the plastics
supply chain without sufficient investment in the
plastics value recovery chain (reduction, recovery,
re-use and recycling), causes and contributes to this
harm. To remedy the problem, governments should:</p>
<p>Extend investor liability for any future envi-
ronmental or health related legal challenges
to those responsible for plastic pollution,
especially effects of it entering the food
chain.</p>
<p>Introduce a mandatory tax on virgin plastic
at the point of importation to or production
within a country, in order to raise its price
relative to recycled plastics, achieving
equivalence by channeling the receipts from
the tax into incentives to recover and reuse
plastics waste streams. This would require
trade related controls to ensure equivalence
in imported packaging.</p>
<p>Invest in a new generation of recycled
plastics markets by establishing forward
contracting arrangements akin to renew-
able energy feed in tariffs to incentivise
investment in modern recycled plastics
value chains.</p>

<p><em>PFAS - “forever chemicals”</em></p>
<p>The end of humankind? It may be coming sooner than we think, thanks to hormone-disrupting chemicals that are decimating fertility at an alarming rate around the globe. A new book called Countdown, by Shanna Swan, an environmental and reproductive epidemiologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, finds that sperm counts have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/feb/26/falling-sperm-counts-human-survival">dropped almost 60% since 1973</a>. Following the trajectory we are on, Swan’s research suggests sperm counts could reach zero by 2045. Zero. Let that sink in. That would mean no babies. No reproduction. No more humans. Forgive me for asking: why isn’t the UN calling an emergency meeting on this right now?</p>
<p>The chemicals to blame for this crisis are found in everything from plastic containers and food wrapping, to waterproof clothes and fragrances in cleaning products, to soaps and shampoos, to electronics and carpeting. Some of them, called PFAS, are known as “forever chemicals,” because they don’t breakdown in the environment or the human body. They just accumulate and accumulate – doing more and more damage, minute by minute, hour by hour, day by day. Now, it seems, humanity is reaching a breaking point.</p>
<p>As if this wasn’t terrifying enough, Swan’s research finds that these chemicals aren’t just dramatically reducing semen quality, they are also shrinking penis size and volume of the testes.</p>
<p>In the state of Washington, lawmakers managed to pass the Pollution Prevention for Our Future Act, which “directs state agencies to address classes of chemicals and moves away from a chemical by chemical approach, which has historically resulted in companies switching to equally bad or worse substitutes. The first chemical classes to be addressed in products include phthalates, PFAS, PCBs, alkyphenol ethoxylate and bisphenol compounds, and organohalogen flame retardants.” The state has taken important steps to address the extent of chemical pollution, but by and large, the United States, like many other countries, is fighting a losing battle because of weak, inadequate legislation.</p>

<p>Perfluoroalkyl compounds (PFCs) are a class of organic molecules that are used in many
everyday products such as oil and water repellents, coatings for cookware, carpets, and
textiles. Their attractive physio-chemical characteristics (i.e., colourless, odourless, high
thermal stability, low chemical reactivity and durability), high availability and low cost
ensure widespread use in the industry but also drive persistent accumulation into the
environment, making them a potential biohazard for human health.
Indeed, PFCs have been found in human fluids and tissues including
the brain, placenta, and testis, which are protected by strong selective barriers.
Interestingly, and for unknown reasons, there
seems to be a sex-dependent pharmacodynamic profile, with adult males having a much
higher tendency to PFCs accumulation and lower clearance.</p>
<p>PFCs may be absorbed by the intestine or inhaled and,
once in the circulation, they may act as endocrine disruptors (ED) ultimately leading to
genital disorders, such as impaired spermatogenesis and reproductive defects, and
antiandrogenic-driven conditions, such as testicular dysgenesis syndrome, which is an
established risk factor for testis cancer.
PFCs could exert their toxicity on the foetus,
new-born, as well as during development, especially in teenagers due to alterations in sex
hormones biosynthesis.</p>
<p>This study documents that PFCs have a substantial impact on human male health as they
directly interfere with hormonal pathways potentially leading to male infertility. We found
that increased levels of PFCs in plasma and seminal fluid positively correlate with circulating
T and with a reduction of semen quality, testicular volume, penile length and AGD (ano-genital distance).</p>

<p><em>PFAS</em></p>
<p>The UK government is not testing drinking water for a group of toxic manmade chemicals linked to a range of diseases including cancers, while across the world people are falling sick and suing for hundreds of millions of dollars at a time after finding the substances in their tap water.</p>
<p>Known collectively as PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), or “forever chemicals” because they are designed never to break down in the environment, the substances are used for their water- and grease-repellent properties in everything from cookware and clothing to furniture, carpets, packaging, coatings and firefighting foams.</p>
<p>When PFAS, of which there are thousands, enter the environment, they accumulate in soil, water, animals and human blood. Following a landmark legal case in the US made famous by the Mark Ruffalo film Dark Waters, a huge epidemiological study was carried out that linked PFAS to high cholesterol, ulcerative colitis, thyroid disease, testicular cancer, kidney cancer and pregnancy-induced hypertension.</p>
<p>Separate studies have made connections between PFAS and miscarriage, reduced birth weight, endocrine disruption, reduced sperm quality, delayed puberty, early menopause and reduced immune response to tetanus vaccination. Scientists have also found that the substances can be passed from mother to baby via the placenta and breast milk.</p>
<p>The EU recently revised its drinking water directive, reducing the acceptable level to 100ng/l for 20 types of PFAS and 500 ng/l for all PFAS substances. The directive entered into force in January and member states have two years to adopt it.</p>
<p>An outright ban on all non-essential uses of PFAS is under discussion among EU countries, but there are no signs that the UK intends to take the same tack.</p>
<p>Responding to the use restrictions put in place on PFOS and PFOA, the industry has created replacement chemicals known as <a href="https://www.endsreport.com/article/1589354/pfoa-replacement-deemed-substance-high-concern">GenX</a>, but researchers suggest these could be just as harmful to humans and the environment, and could be even harder to detect.</p>

<p><strong>Perfluorinated Chemicals</strong></p>
<p>Perfluorinated chemicals is a term that some scientists use to refer to the group of toxic chemicals that includes PFOA and PFOS and other per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs).</p>
<p><strong>Perfluorocarbons</strong></p>
<p>The other “PFCs” – perfluorocarbons –
is a group of chemicals closely related to PFASs that share common features with PFASs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both perfluorocarbon and PFAS molecules contain fluorine and carbon atoms.</li>
<li>Both persist in the environment for long periods.</li>
<li>PFAS are not found naturally in the environment. The same is true for perfluorocarbons, with the exception that small amounts of one perfluorocarbon, carbon tetrafluoride, are emitted from granite.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perfluorocarbons, however, are quite different from PFASs in significant respects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unlike PFAS molecules, which can include oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur and/or nitrogen atoms, perfluorocarbon molecules contain only carbon and fluorine atoms.</li>
<li>Perfluorocarbons are used in and emitted from different applications and industries than PFASs are.</li>
<li>The effects of perfluorocarbons on human health and the environment are substantially different than the effects of PFASs:
<ul>
<li><p>Perfluorocarbons are not toxic, and there are no direct health effects associated with exposures to them.</p></li>
<li><p>However, perfluorocarbons are among the most potent and longest-lasting type of greenhouse gases emitted by human activities; the chief impact of environmental concern is global climate change. Some Clean Air Act regulations apply to perfluorocarbons. If you view an EPA web page about atmospheric or climate issues or programs, and you see the term “PFCs,” that page is likely to be referring to perfluorocarbons, rather than to the larger set of perfluorinated chemicals (PFASs). EPA programs that seek to understand and reduce emissions of perfluorocarbons include the:</p></li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.1</span> TCE -&gt; Parkinson</h3>
<p>A Parkinson’s epidemic is on the horizon. Parkinson’s is already the fastest-growing neurological disorder in the world; in the US, the number of people with Parkinson’s has increased 35% the last 10 years, says Dorsey, and “We think over the next 25 years it will double again.”</p>
<p>Most cases of Parkinson’s disease are considered idiopathic – they lack a clear cause. Yet researchers increasingly believe that one factor is environmental exposure to trichloroethylene (TCE), a chemical compound used in industrial degreasing, dry-cleaning and household products such as some shoe polishes and carpet cleaners.</p>
<p>Six-fold increase in the risk of developing Parkinson’s in individuals exposed in the workplace to trichloroethylene (TCE)</p>
<p>TCE is a carcinogen linked to renal cell carcinoma, cancers of the cervix, liver, biliary passages, lymphatic system and male breast tissue, and fetal cardiac defects, among other effects. Its known relationship to Parkinson’s may often be overlooked due to the fact that exposure to TCE can predate the disease’s onset by decades.</p>
<p>Its use is banned in the EU without special authorization.</p>
<p><strong>Silicon Valley Exposure</strong></p>
<p>Those near National Priorities List Superfund sites (sites known to be contaminated with hazardous substances such as TCE) are at especially high risk of exposure. Santa Clara county, California, for example, is home not only to Silicon Valley, but 23 superfund sites – the highest concentration in the country. Google Quad Campus sits atop one such site; for several months in 2012 and 2013, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found employees of the company were inhaling unsafe levels of TCE in the form of toxic vapor rising up from the ground beneath their offices.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.3.2</span> VOC</h3>
<p>While emissions from petroleum products like gasoline or jet fuel have long been known to be dangerous and are subject to state and federal regulation, asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil, classified as “heavy refinery liquids,” have been largely ignored by regulators because it was thought that their emissions were negligible.</p>
<p>But in an 18-month investigation, Inside Climate News found that emissions from heated tanks containing asphalt and No. 6 fuel oil pose a risk to the health of millions of Americans who live close to the tanks, one that federal and state regulators have failed to adequately address.</p>
<p>Changes in the petroleum refining process over the last 30 years have resulted in significant emissions from the two products when they are heated in tanks, as they must be to keep their contents in liquid form. And these emissions often contain VOCs that can pose a threat to human health, in some cases at levels high enough to violate federal clean air standards. The chemicals also combine with other pollutants to form ozone, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change.</p>
<p>Yet companies that own the tanks have been routinely underreporting the extent of their emissions because instead of measuring the vapors from tanks, they estimate them using a set of equations developed by the petroleum industry and approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
<p>And those equations, it turns out, are often wrong.</p>
<p>Federal regulators and some industry insiders have known this for more than a decade, but have taken no action to mandate that companies report emissions or measure them directly. As a result, some states do not even require companies to track emissions from tanks containing asphalt or No. 6, and an overwhelming majority of states that do require it rely on the estimates from the petroleum industry equations.</p>

<p><strong>Regulators missing pollution’s effect on marine life, study finds</strong></p>
<p>Increasing chemical and plastic pollution are “significant” contributors to the decline of fish and other aquatic organisms, yet their impact is being missed by regulators.
The report, <a href="https://ipen.org/transfer/embargo/aquatic_pollutants_in_oceans_and_fisheries_ipen-en.pdf">Aquatic Pollutants in Oceans and Fisheries</a>, by the International Pollutants Elimination Network and the National Toxics Network, draws together scientific research on how pollution is adversely affecting the aquatic food chain. It catalogues the “serious impacts” of “invisible killers” such as persistent organic pollutants and excessive nutrients on the immunity, fertility, development and survivaL of aquatic animals.</p>
<p>Regulation of fisheries does not always take into account biologically or scientifically relevant data on all contributors to the health of fish populations, leading to a “narrow view” of declining numbers based on quota catch rates and efforts. “Regulators have yet to grasp the impact of pollution,” the report says.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">9.4.1</span> Overflows</h3>
<p>Raw sewage had been pumped into English rivers via storm overflows more than 200,000 times in 2019. In November, Surfers Against Sewage (SAS) published <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/06/raw-sewage-dumped-into-english-and-welsh-beaches-2900-times-this-year">data</a> showing that untreated wastewater was discharged on to English and Welsh beaches on 2,900 occasions in a year.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency published, for the first time, full <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/mar/31/water-firms-discharged-raw-sewage-into-english-waters-400000-times-last-year">data</a> on raw sewage discharges last year, showing a 37% year-on-year increase: 3.1m hours of human effluent flows, pumped via storm drains into English waters in some 400,000 occasions.</p>
<p>The prevalence of raw sewage in British waters is not only about the horror of swimming amid human waste but about the health and environmental threats of microplastics (especially from laundry water), endocrine disruptors (chemicals that interfere with hormones found in plastics, detergents and cosmetics), phosphorus (which causes algae blooms), antibiotic-resistant bacteria and even Covid-19 – all spread through wastewater.</p>
<p>Good days are increasingly rare. Previously, only freak storms would fill the system to the point that the toxic soup would spill out into waterways (to avoid the even grislier prospect of it spouting back up our drains).</p>
<p>Vast tanks, such as those under the promenades in Blackpool and Brighton, have been built to hold excess stormwater, so it can be fed back into sewers once the water levels in the sewers drop. But this “grey infrastructure approach” is not a long-term solution.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS)</strong></p>
<p>A key example of green infrastructure solutions are <em>sustainable drainage systems</em>, known as SuDS. These allow the environment to absorb, slow and divert water. They use wetlands, ponds and green ditches called swales, as well as green roofs, rainwater-harvesting systems and replacing nonabsorbent surfaces with porous asphalt or gravel.</p>
<p><img src="fig/Wuhan-Storm_Corridor.png" /></p>
<p><em>Figure: Xinyuexie Park, Wuhan, China, designed to improve a natural storm corridor.</em></p>
<p>SuDS have been used to stunning effect in China, where flood-prone cities, such as Wuhan, have come to be known as “sponge cities,” full of beautiful, biodiverse parkland that holds on to water. Other examples include Malmö in Sweden, which blazed a trail for “blue-green cities” at the turn of the century after introducing a series of trenches, ponds and wetlands to absorb up to 90% of its stormwater. Davis says the Environment Agency is also looking at “Copenhagen, as well as some of the American and Canadian examples – Seattle and Vancouver – where they’re trying these different approaches.”</p>
<p><strong>Fuzzy Logic Network</strong></p>
<p>SuDS and concrete tanks are not the only weapons in the anti-sewage spill arsenal. Fatbergs and other blockages can trigger sewage pollution events, so having a better idea of what’s going on underground is essential. Harrison says Yorkshire Water is working with Siemens on a <a href="https://www.waterindustryjournal.co.uk/fuzzy-logic-clear-up-blockage-prediction-for-yorkshire-water">pilot “fuzzy logic” network</a> around Ilkley, which uses real-time rainfall data, AI and sensors to better predict blockages. So far, the project has been able to predict nine out of 10 blockages – three times more accurate than existing statistical modelling – while reducing false alarms by half.</p>
<p><strong>Flushless Toilets</strong></p>
<p>A more radical solution to the sewage crisis is to do away with sewers altogether.</p>
<p>For people with gardens, waste would be sanitised and deodorised within the toilet unit, “and the end-product would be made available directly to the user: this would likely involve heat-treatment as the best way to stabilise and dewater the waste as much as possible.” The sanitised waste could then be added to compost heaps.</p>
<p>Another concept is to use a municipal collection system where the product is combined with garden or food waste collections.</p>
<p>The nano-membrane toilet, developed by Cranfield University. Liquids undergo evaporation, killing many pathogens in the process, and can then be used for washing or irrigation, while solids are burned, producing enough energy to power the unit.
Fails to recover some of the useful resources in human waste.</p>

<p><strong>Study on DNA spread by genetically modified mosquitoes prompts backlash</strong></p>
<p>For 10 years, the company Oxitec has been testing whether genetically modified (GM) mosquitoes can suppress populations of their natural brethren, which carry devastating viruses such as Zika and dengue. Its strategy: Deploy (nonbiting) male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes bearing a gene that should doom most of their offspring before adulthood.</p>
<p>Now, a team of independent researchers analyzing an early trial of Oxitec’s technology is raising alarm—and drawing fire from the firm—with a report that some offspring of the GM mosquitoes survived and produced offspring that also made it to sexual maturity. As a result, local mosquitoes inherited pieces of the genomes of the GM mosquitoes, the team revealed last week in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49660-6">Scientific Reports</a>.</p>
<p>There’s no evidence that these hybrids endanger humans more than the wild mosquitoes or that they’ll render Oxitec’s strategy ineffective, both the paper’s authors and the company agree. “The important thing is something unanticipated happened,” says population geneticist Jeffrey Powell of Yale University, who did the study with Brazilian researchers. “When people develop transgenic lines or anything to release, almost all of their information comes from laboratory studies. … Things don’t always work out the way you expect.”</p>
<p>But the paper’s suggestion that this genetic mixing could have made the mosquito population “more robust”—more resistant to insecticides, for example, or more likely to transmit disease—has triggered anti-GM news reports, a backlash from some scientists, and strong pushback from Oxitec. The company, a subsidiary of U.S. biotech Intrexon, has a lot at stake; it recently submitted a new generation of its GM mosquitoes for U.S. regulatory review and hopes to conduct its first U.S. field test next year.</p>
<p>Even before Oxitec conducted pilot releases of its altered mosquitoes in Brazil, Malaysia, and the Cayman Islands, it knew the inserted gene wasn’t inevitably lethal. Lab tests had shown that when the GM males mated with wild females, roughly 3% of their offspring survived. “We’ve been very clear about that,” Rose says.</p>
<p>What wasn’t clear was whether those rare offspring, often sickly in the lab, could themselves produce progeny, Powell says. To see whether the survivors fared well enough in the wild to spread their DNA, he contacted Oxitec’s collaborators on the eve of a large field trial in the Brazilian city of Jacobina. From 2013 to 2015, Oxitec released roughly 450,000 GM male mosquitoes per week there—which the company reported reduced the overall mosquito population by about 90%. Powell and his collaborators collected mosquitoes from several neighborhoods before, during, and in the 3 months after the trial. Within these populations, they estimate, between 5% and 60% of the insects had some DNA from the Oxitec strain in their genome—as much as 13% of the genome in one case.</p>
<p>Oxitec’s latest strain of GM mosquitoes is designed to spread the lethal gene more effectively. Instead of killing offspring regardless of sex, it eliminates only the females. Male offspring survive to pass on the lethal gene. In a Brazilian field trial, these second-generation mosquitoes caused local populations to dip by as much as 96%, Oxitec announced in June.</p>
