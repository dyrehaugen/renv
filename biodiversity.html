<pre><code>- Making food and energy systems sustainable through technological innovations and policies that change prices and behavioural norms

<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-55893696">Dasgupta Review (BBC)</a></p>
<p>The Dasgupta Review is an independent, global review on the Economics of Biodiversity led by Professor Sir Partha Dasgupta (Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus, University of Cambridge). The Review was commissioned in 2019 by HM Treasury and has been supported by an Advisory Panel.</p>
<p><strong>The Review calls for changes in how we think, act and measure economic success.</strong></p>
<p>The new framework presented by the Review sets out
how we should account for Nature in economics and decision-making.</p>
<p>The Review finds that humanity has collectively mis-managed its global portfolio of assets,
meaning the demands on nature far exceed its capacity to supply the goods and services
we all rely on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Humanity must ensure its demands on nature do not exceed its sustainable supply and must increase the global supply of natural assets relative to their current level. For example, expanding and improving management of Protected Areas; increasing investment in Nature-based Solutions; and deploying policies that discourage damaging forms of consumption and production.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We should adopt different metrics for economic success and move towards an inclusive measure of wealth that accounts for the benefits from investing in natural assets and helps to make clear the trade-offs between investments in different assets. Introducing natural capital into national accounting systems is a critical step.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We must transform our institutions and systems – particularly finance and education – to enable these changes and sustain them for future generations. For example, by increasing public and private financial flows that enhance our natural assets and decrease those that degrade them; and by empowering citizens to make informed choices and demand change, including by firmly establishing the natural world in education policy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Reactionn from Mark Carney.</em>
Ecosystems that have more diverse natural assets are more productive, resilient and adaptable. Just as diversity within a financial portfolio reduces risk and uncertainty, greater biodiversity reduces risks and uncertainty within a portfolio of natural assets. As we awaken to the importance of natural capital, we need to place greater value on sustainability and biodiversity – the precondition to solving the twin crises of biodiversity and climate.</p>
<p><em>Reactionfrom Christiana Figueres:</em>
It is less costly to conserve Nature than to restore it once it’s damaged or degraded and provides the economic rationale for expanding and improving the management of protected areas. We can translate this idea into action by protecting 30% of the planet by 2030. The Review lays the foundation for how to address the twin crises of biodiversity and climate.</p>
<p><em>Reaction from Andrew Haldane:</em>
Most of economics and economic policy has neglected the role of Nature and
underplayed the importance of biodiversity in protecting both Nature and, ultimately, us.</p>
<p><em>Reaction from James E. Hansen:</em>
Flourishing nature, restoration of a healthy climate, and economic well-being of all humanity can co-exist, but they require understanding. Dasgupta’s Review helps us begin a journey, which will require decades.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/final-report-the-economics-of-biodiversity-the-dasgupta-review/the-economics-of-biodiversity-the-dasgupta-review-reactions">Dasgupta Review Reactions at Launch</a></p>
<p><strong>Memo Dasgupta:</strong></p>
<p>While most models of economic growth and development recognise that Nature is capable only
of producing a finite flow of goods and services, the focus has been to show that technological
progress can, in principle, overcome that exhaustibility. This is to imagine that, ultimately,
humanity is ‘external’ to Nature.
The Review develops the economics of biodiversity on the understanding that we – and our
economies – are ‘embedded’ within Nature, not external to it. The Review’s approach is based
firmly in what we know from ecology about how ecosystems function, and how they are
affected by economic activity, including the extraction of natural resources for our production
and consumption, and the waste we produce through these activities, which ultimately damages
ecosystems and undermines their ability to provide the services on which we rely. This approach
helps us to understand that the human economy is bounded and reshapes our understanding
of what constitutes truly sustainable economic growth and development: accounting fully for
the impact of our interactions with Nature and rebalancing our demand with Nature’s capacity
to supply.</p>
<p>The change required should be geared towards three broad <strong>transitions</strong>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p>Ensure that our demands on Nature do not exceed its supply,
and that we <strong>increase</strong> (<em>sic!!</em>) Nature’s supply relative to its current level.</p></li>
<li><p>Change our measures of economic success to guide us on a
more sustainable path.</p></li>
<li><p>Transform our institutions and systems – in particular our
finance and education systems – to enable these changes and
sustain them for future generations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Not so long ago, when the
world was very different from what it is now, the economic questions that needed urgent
response could be studied most productively by excluding Nature from economic models.
Nature entered macroeconomic models of growth and development in the 1970s, but in an
inessential form. 3 The thought was that human ingenuity could overcome Nature’s scarcity over
time, and ultimately (formally, in the limit) allow humanity to be free of Nature’s constraints.
But the practice of building economic models on the backs of those that had most recently been
designed meant that the macroeconomics of growth and development continued to be built
without Nature’s appearance as an essential entity in our economic lives.</p>
<p>The natural world is studied in relation to the many other assets we
hold in our portfolios, such as the vehicles we use for transport, the homes in which we live,
and the machines and equipment that furnish our offices and factories. But like education and
health, Nature is more than a mere economic good. Nature nurtures and nourishes us, so we
will think of assets as durable entities that not only have use value, but may also have intrinsic
worth. Once we make that extension, the economics of biodiversity becomes a study in portfolio
management.</p>
<p>Finance plays a crucial role. A significant portion of the responsibility for helping us to shift
course will fall on the global financial system.</p>
<p><strong>To leave Nature alone so that it is able to thrive is to invest in it.</strong></p>
<p>The risks associated with biodiversity loss – reductions in the productivity and resilience of
ecosystems along supply chains – have significant macroeconomic and financial implications.
Far more global support is needed for initiatives directed at enhancing the understanding and
awareness among financial institutions of Nature-related financial risks, learning and building
on the advances on climate-related financial risks.</p>
<p>Central banks and financial supervisors can
support this by assessing the systemic extent of Nature-related financial risks. A set of global
standards is required. They should be underpinned by data that are both credible and useful for
decision-making. Businesses and financial institutions could then be obliged to integrate Nature-
related considerations with their other objectives. The idea ultimately is to have them assess
and disclose their use of natural capital. The Task Force on Nature-related Financial Disclosures,
(TNFD) established in 2020, is a step in that direction.</p>
<p>Integrating the protection of biodiversity with the fiduciary duties of
institutional investors and asset managers
would be a way to ensure their investment policies account for natural capital.</p>
<p>The time horizonwithin which financial actors plan and act is, unhappily (!!sic!!),
not more than a few years.
Financial regulators and supervisors can play a key role in the necessary shift
by changing their own assessment horizons and using their regulatory powers.</p>
<p><em>Moral Issue</em>
Ultimately though, it is we citizens who can bring about such changes. (!!sic!!)
Connecting with Nature needs to be woven throughout our lives.
The three pervasive features of Nature – mobility, silence and invisibility –
mean that the consequences of actions
which desecrate Nature are often untraceable to those who are responsible.
We will have to rely also on self-enforcement, that is, be our own
judge and jury.</p>
<p><strong>Memo Main Report:</strong>
Now we are plundering every corner of the world, apparently neither knowing or caring what
the consequences might be.</p>
<p>Today, we ourselves, together with the livestock we rear for
food, constitute 96% of the mass of all mammals on the planet. Only 4% is everything else –
from elephants to badgers, from moose to monkeys. And 70% of all birds alive at this moment
are poultry – mostly chickens for us to eat.</p>
<p><em>GDP</em>
The contemporary practice of using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to judge
economic performance is based on a faulty application of economics. GDP is a flow (so many
market dollars of output per year), in contrast to inclusive wealth, which is a stock (it is the
social worth of the economy’s entire portfolio of assets). Relatedly, GDP does not include the
depreciation of assets, for example the degradation of the natural environment (we should
remember that ‘G’ in GDP stands for gross output of final goods and services, not output net
of depreciation of assets). As a measure of economic activity, GDP is indispensable in short-run
macroeconomic analysis and management, but it is wholly unsuitable for appraising investment
projects and identifying sustainable development. Nor was GDP intended by economists who
fashioned it to be used for those two purposes. An economy could record a high rate of
growth of GDP by depreciating its assets, but one would not know that from national statistics.</p>
<p><strong>VALUES</strong>
Correct economic reasoning is entangled with our values. Biodiversity does not only have
instrumental value, it also has existence and intrinsic value, perhaps even moral worth.</p>
<p><strong>(Use) Value</strong> vs <strong>(Intrinsic) Worth</strong> vs <strong>(Social) Worth</strong> vs <strong>(Inclusive) Wealth</strong>
Nature is more than a mere economic good. Nature nurtures and nourishes us,
so we will think of assets as durable entities that not only have use value, but may also have
intrinsic worth. Once we make that extension, the economics of biodiversity becomes a study in
portfolio management.</p>
<p>In order to judge whether the path of economic development
we choose to follow is sustainable, nations need to adopt a system of economic accounts that
records an inclusive measure of their wealth. <strong>The qualifier <em>inclusive</em> says that wealth includes
Nature as an asset.</strong></p>
<p>The contemporary practice of using Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to judge
economic performance is based on a faulty application of economics. GDP is a flow (so many
market dollars of output per year), in contrast to inclusive wealth, which is a stock (it is the
social worth of the economy’s entire portfolio of assets)</p>
<p><em>Inclusive Wealth</em>
The accounting value of an economy’s stock of capital goods is its inclusive wealth. The qualifier
signals that the notion of wealth adopted here differs from the one in common use in two ways:
(i) accounting prices are not necessarily market prices; and (ii) in addition to produced capital,
wealth includes human capital and natural capital. As accounting prices measure the social
worth of goods and services, the inclusive wealth of a nation is the social worth of its capital
goods. As noted previously, by ‘social worth’ we mean not only the worth to people who are
alive at that date, but also to future people.</p>
<p><strong>Valueing Biodiversity</strong>
Ecosystems are capital goods. Biodiversity is a characteristic of ecosystems. In the terminology
introduced in Chapter 1, it is an enabling asset.</p>
<p>Humanity’s future will be shaped by the portfolio of <strong>assets</strong> we inherit and choose to pass on,
and by the balance we strike between the portfolio and the size of our population. <em>Assets are
durable objects, producing streams of services</em>. Their durability enables us to save them for our
own future, offer them as gifts to others, exchange them for other goods and services, and
bequeath them to our children. Durability does not mean everlasting. Assets depreciate, but
unlike services they are not fleeting.</p>
<p><em>Capital Assets</em>
Perhaps because financial capital has figured prominently in
economists’ writings, the qualifier ‘capital’ is sometimes added to assets, as in ‘capital assets.’
Assets acquire their value from the services they provide over their remaining life</p>
<p><em>Wealth Accounts</em>
a deep connection
between inclusive wealth and intergenerational well-being. We prove that any change in one
is mirrored in a corresponding change in the other. The correspondence is named the wealth/
well-being equivalence theorem. We show that the theorem offers a way to judge whether the
development path an economy is following meets the requirement of sustainability. The theorem
is also shown to be the right criterion for evaluating public policy. Inclusive wealth is the coin
with which economic progress or its absence should be measured. Private companies prepare
balance sheets. The theorem shows why countries should now prepare wealth accounts.</p>
<p><strong>Capital Goods</strong> vs <strong>Enabling Assets</strong>
In our classification, there are thus three categories of capital goods and
a wide range of enabling assets.
Three-way partition of <em>capital goods</em>: produced capital (buildings, roads,
ports, machines, instruments), human capital (population size, health, education, reputation,
knowledge and skills) and natural capital (ecosystems, sub-soil resources).
What remains – institutions and practices, more generally, social capital, and
publicly available knowledge –
we will call <em>enabling assets</em>,
because they confer value to the three classes of capital goods by facilitating their use.</p>
<p>** Economic Evaluation**
Management of a society’s portfolio of assets involves
policy analysis and
sustainability assessment.
We call the two generically as economic evaluation.</p>
<p><em>(Green Book 6.48)</em>
A focus solely on the marginal valuation of a loss in services may overlook the potential
for large reductions in stocks.</p>
<p><em>Pollinators</em>
At smaller levels of aggregation, total values of Nature’s services can be meaningful and yet not
be useful for policy. It is tempting, for example, to cite the estimate that pollination contributes
an annual £510-690 million to the UK’s agricultural production as providing a reason for
restoring the population of pollinators (Breeze, Roberts, and Potts, 2012). But should we regard
it to be a large or small figure? Based on 2019 data from the UK Office of National Statistics,
as a proportion of the UK’s annual agricultural output, it is approximately 5%. As a proportion
of the UK’s GDP, it is 0.03%, a negligible figure. So why care whether any pollinators are left?
The reason we should not be dismissive of pollinators is that proportional figures do not signal
worth. National asset management requires that pollinators enter projects with their accounting
prices. Chapters 2 to 4 demonstrate that pollinators may be of great value even if their
measurable services to GDP are of negligible worth.</p>

<p><em>Carrington</em></p>
<p>The costs of damage caused by invasions of alien species across the world
is trebling every decade, research has found.</p>
<p>Mosquitoes, rats, ragweeds and termites are among the species that have hitched a ride on globalised trade routes, bringing disease, crop destruction and damage to buildings. The scientists calculated the costs at $1.3tn (£944bn) since 1970, and said even this “staggering sum” was likely to be a big underestimate as much damage is unreported.</p>

<p><em>Diagne</em></p>
<p>Biological invasions are responsible for substantial biodiversity declines as well as high economic losses to society and monetary expenditures associated with the management of these invasions1,2. The InvaCost database has enabled the generation of a reliable, comprehensive, standardized and easily updatable synthesis of the monetary costs of biological invasions worldwide3. Here we found that the total reported costs of invasions reached a minimum of US$1.288 trillion (2017 US dollars) over the past few decades (1970–2017), with an annual mean cost of US$26.8 billion. Moreover, we estimate that the annual mean cost could reach US$162.7 billion in 2017. These costs remain strongly underestimated and do not show any sign of slowing down, exhibiting a consistent threefold increase per decade. We show that the documented costs are widely distributed and have strong gaps at regional and taxonomic scales, with damage costs being an order of magnitude higher than management expenditures. Research approaches that document the costs of biological invasions need to be further improved. Nonetheless, our findings call for the implementation of consistent management actions and international policy agreements that aim to reduce the burden of invasive alien species.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Degradation Loss</h2>
<p><em>Ellis Significance</em></p>
<p>The current biodiversity crisis is often depicted as a struggle to preserve untouched habitats. Here, we combine global maps of human populations and land use over the past 12,000 y with current biodiversity data to show that nearly three quarters of terrestrial nature has long been shaped by diverse histories of human habitation and use by Indigenous and traditional peoples. With rare exceptions, current biodiversity losses are caused not by human conversion or degradation of untouched ecosystems, but rather by the appropriation, colonization, and intensification of use in lands inhabited and used by prior societies. Global land use history confirms that empowering the environmental stewardship of Indigenous peoples and local communities will be critical to conserving biodiversity across the planet.</p>
<p><em>Ellis Abstract</em></p>
<p>Archaeological and paleoecological evidence shows that by 10,000 BCE, all human societies employed varying degrees of ecologically transformative land use practices, including burning, hunting, species propagation, domestication, cultivation, and others that have left long-term legacies across the terrestrial biosphere. Yet, a lingering paradigm among natural scientists, conservationists, and policymakers is that human transformation of terrestrial nature is mostly recent and inherently destructive. Here, we use the most up-to-date, spatially explicit global reconstruction of historical human populations and land use to show that this paradigm is likely wrong. Even 12,000 y ago, nearly three quarters of Earth’s land was inhabited and therefore shaped by human societies, including more than 95% of temperate and 90% of tropical woodlands. Lands now characterized as “natural,” “intact,” and “wild” generally exhibit long histories of use, as do protected areas and Indigenous lands, and current global patterns of vertebrate species richness and key biodiversity areas are more strongly associated with past patterns of land use than with present ones in regional landscapes now characterized as natural. The current biodiversity crisis can seldom be explained by the loss of uninhabited wildlands, resulting instead from the appropriation, colonization, and intensifying use of the biodiverse cultural landscapes long shaped and sustained by prior societies. Recognizing this deep cultural connection with biodiversity will therefore be essential to resolve the crisis.</p>
<p><em>Ellis Memo</em></p>
<p><strong>Natural History Is Human History</strong></p>
<p>Contemporary patterns of biodiversity-rich areas, areas priori-
tized for conservation, and those specifically labeled “natural” all
show long and significant histories of human use</p>
<p><img src="fig/anthromes.png" /></p>
<p>Only about 17% of Earth’s land was without
evidence of prior human habitation or use over the past 12,000 y.
Yet, even this low percentage is certainly an overestimate, based
on growing evidence that the most up-to-date global change models
remain biased toward underestimating the importance of early
human habitation and land use, especially in areas where seasonal
and temporary habitation and use of land predominates</p>
